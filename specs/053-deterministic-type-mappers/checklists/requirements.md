# Specification Quality Checklist: Deterministic per-type mappers

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The spec necessarily names the analysis seam (`_rollup_attachment_fields`, `nf_total_for_reconciliation`)
  and the typed JSON field paths because the feature's value is precisely "derive these named
  reconciliation fields deterministically" — those are domain contracts the issue itself specifies,
  not gratuitous implementation detail.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `speckit clarify` or `speckit plan`.
